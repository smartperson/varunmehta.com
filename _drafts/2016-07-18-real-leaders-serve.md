* Alternate titles included, "Real leaders serve," and "Real leaders "
* Goals:
    * Convince readers of importance of employee feedback
    * Specifically, frequent measurement of sentiment
    * Disqovery does this for you!
* How?
    * Look at servers at good restaurants
    * They don't just give you your food and expect a good tip
    * or, give you a link to a survey after you leave (Ã  la an exit intervew)
    * They are extremely attentive to the needs of their people, and make sure to periodicayl ask fr verbal feedback ("Is everything okay?") as well as observe non-verbal feedback (Are the plates clean?)
    * They catch issues early and make course correction to keep everyone as happy as possible.
