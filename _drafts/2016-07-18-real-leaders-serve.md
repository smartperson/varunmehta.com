* Goals:
    * Convince readers of importance of employee feedback
    * Specifically, frequent measurement of sentiment
    * Disqovery does this for you!
* How?
    * Look at servers at good restaurants
    * They don't just give you your food and expect a good tip
    * or, give you a link to a survey after you leave (à la an exit intervew)
    * They are extremely attentive to the needs of their people, and make sure to periodicayl ask fr verbal feedback ("Is everything okay?") as well as observe non-verbal feedback (Are the plates clean?)
    * They catch issues early and make course correction to keep everyone as happy as possible.    

I don't often end up in fancy restaurants, but when I do, I'm impressed by the service I receive. A few friends have previously worked as servers, so I try to tip generously, with a little extra for the truly exceptional.

This got me thinking: a lot of what makes a good waiter also makes for a good people manager. In any talent-driven organization, your employees are a precious resource, and in many ways can be compared to diners at high-quality restaurants. To get the best results out of them (tips), you need to provide them with exceptional service.

This concept isn't new. There are great examples, including from the military, in the book *[Leaders Eat Last](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845327/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591845327&linkCode=as2&tag=varmeh-20&linkId=5c7f7808ddd31482a4d03f69428f025e)*. *As an aside, the author Simon Sinek, has a great TED talk you must check out.*

Aida over at the POS Sector put together 

1. Do not let anyone enter the restaurant without a warm greeting.
8. Do not interrupt a conversation. For any reason. Especially not to recite specials. Wait for the right moment.
14. When you ask, “How’s everything?” or “How was the meal?” listen to the answer and fix whatever is not right.
17. Do not take an empty plate from one guest while others are still eating the same course. Wait, wait, wait.
20. Never refuse to substitute one vegetable for another.
30. Never let the wine bottle touch the glass into which you are pouring. No one wants to drink the dust or dirt from the bottle.
31. Never remove a plate full of food without asking what went wrong. Obviously, something went wrong.
40. Never say, “Good choice,” implying that other choices are bad.
41. Saying, “No problem” is a problem. It has a tone of insincerity or sarcasm. “My pleasure” or “You’re welcome” will do.
57. Bring the pepper mill with the appetizer. Do not make people wait or beg for a condiment.
58. Do not bring judgment with the ketchup. Or mustard. Or hot sauce. Or whatever condiment is requested.
62. Do not fill the water glass every two minutes, or after each sip. You’ll make people nervous.
62. *Do not let a glass sit empty for too long.
63. Never blame the chef or the busboy or the hostess or the weather for anything that goes wrong. Just make it right.
76. Do not ask if a guest is finished the very second the guest is finished. Let guests digest, savor, reflect.
77. Do not disappear.
84. Do not refill a coffee cup compulsively. Ask if the guest desires a refill.
84. *Do not let an empty coffee cup sit too long before asking if a refill is desired.
87. Do not stop your excellent service after the check is presented or paid.
89. Never patronize a guest who has a complaint or suggestion; listen, take it seriously, address it.
95. Never hover long enough to make people feel they are being watched or hurried, especially when they are figuring out the tip or signing for the check.
96. Do not say anything after a tip — be it good, bad, indifferent — except, “Thank you very much.”
99. Do not show frustration. Your only mission is to serve. Be patient. It is not easy.
