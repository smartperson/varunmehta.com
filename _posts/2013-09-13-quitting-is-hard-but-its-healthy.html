<p><em>This is the third post in the series on how <a href="http://blog.disqovery.com/category/quitting/" target="_blank">Quitting is Hard</a>. Each post explores why quitting is good, one potential barrier to quitting, and a way to overcome it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why is quitting important?</strong> <em>You might live longer.</em><strong><br />
</strong>An unusual study out of the <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/18/9/773.abstract" target="_blank">University of British Columbia</a> a few years ago found that when faced with a very difficult goal, those that quit sooner had far lower C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels than those that continued plugging away for 6 or 12 months. CRP is an inflammatory molecule associated with arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, and aging. Goal disengagement and systemic inflammation - who knew that they go hand in hand? You need to know when to call it quits if you want to live a long, healthy life.<!--more--></p>
<p>I encourage you to read the article, if you have access. I know it's about teenage girls, but the lesson is a powerful one.</p>
<p><strong>Why is quitting hard?</strong> <em>We are biased towards never giving up.<br />
</em>Culturally, we feel that when the going gets tough, the tough get going: sticking with a difficult situation is a badge of honor and commands the respect of others. I'm not going to disagree with this sentiment, but clearly there is a point where enough is enough and quitting is the best option.</p>
<p><strong>How do we overcome this bias?</strong><em> Basic reflection should guide us.<br />
</em>First by being aware of this bias, you've taken a step towards overcoming it. Here are some questions to ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Am I in a difficult situation?</strong> You'd know it if you are.</li>
<li><strong>Do I think it is affecting my health?</strong> Mood. Appetite. Sleep patterns…</li>
<li><strong>Do others think it is affecting my health?</strong> Pay attention to what people close to you are saying.</li>
<li><strong>What are my options?</strong> This is critical. 'Quitting' doesn't necessarily mean submitting your resignation! You might ask for additional resources, switch projects, or redefine what is expected of you. Consider it.</li>
<li><strong>What would the short-term impact of quitting be?</strong> Number from 1 to 10.</li>
<li><strong>What would the long-term impact of quitting be? </strong>Number from 1 to 10.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em.</em></p>
