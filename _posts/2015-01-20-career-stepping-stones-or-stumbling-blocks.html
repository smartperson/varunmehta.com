<h2>Career Stepping Stones or Stumbling Blocks?</h2>
<p>I recently embarked on a new chapter in my career by switching from something that I was definitely good at to a job that is a big leap for me in terms of skill set. I have three challenges in the upcoming year and have been spending a lot of time thinking about my approach to overcoming them during my holiday break.</p>
<p>At first, I was upset because of the overwhelming odds, but then I remembered what I learned about leadership. I started learning about leadership in military school and have been studying it in some shape or form ever since.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to see military leadership exemplified in the corporate world because I ended up working for a manager that graduated from West Point. He managed to transform an organization that was on the verge of chaos into a high-functioning team with extraordinary morale.</p>
<p>Here are <strong>a)</strong> my challenges, <strong>b)</strong> the toxic employee’s approach, and <strong>c)</strong> the leader’s approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Finance Skillset</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>Finance background is not strong.</li>
<li>Just coast and learn as you go.</li>
<li>Take initiative to learn as much on my own by asking a lot of questions, reading books, and watching videos.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>New Team</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>Four out of the five people in my team are new and we are learning how to mesh as a team.</li>
<li>Compete with team members, don’t let others shine, and follow the lead of people with toxic attitudes.</li>
<li>Encourage the team, share my strengths, acknowledge my weaknesses, and gain rapport through humor.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Organizational Chaos</strong>
<ol type="a">
<li>The company just went through a large acquisition and almost everything is changing. Everyone has to get up to speed on the organization’s processes and systems.</li>
<li>Complain without suggesting a resolution to the problems.</li>
<li>Flex my organizational skills by openly communicating with my team, structuring the processes properly, and solving the 20% of the issues that will act as a force multiplier for completing 80% of the workload.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Leadership is a behavior and attitude that is exercised and it can transform your stumbling blocks into stepping stones.</strong></p>
