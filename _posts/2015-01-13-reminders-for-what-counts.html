<p>Hey people, just a quick note that you might see a friendly reminder from me if you miss a job check-in. We've seen a lot of users miss one of our e-mails, and up until today we'd never follow-up with you to bring you in and get you back on track. <a href="mailto:varun@disqovery.com">Let me know</a> what you think.</p>
<p>- Varun</p>
