<p>Many of us have recently received our degrees, and that high is just starting to wear off. I feel like there is something really special about graduation â€“ it is one of the few occasions where people will congratulate you, but also wish you "good luck."<br />

<p><strong>Who is Ganesh? What does he have to do with any of this?</strong><br />
<img class=" wp-image-10 alignleft" alt="Lord Ganesh" src="/images/2013/06/LordGanesh-236x300.jpg" width="142" height="180" />If you don't know, Ganesh is one of the avatars ("gods") of Hinduism. <a title="Info on how awesome Ganesh is" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha" target="_blank">Ganesh</a> (pronounced guh-naysh) is seen as the remover of obstacles, and lord of learning. It is common practice for Hindus to give a small figure of Ganesh to a loved one when he is about to embark on a new endeavor. I'm going to call the moment which one would give a Ganesh figure a "Ganesh-able Moment."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are some other similar moments?</strong><br />
Everyone's life will have their own types of Ganesh-able Moments, but some of them include: graduations, weddings, having kids, and <strong>bold</strong> career changes. You've had a couple of these moments already, and you're familiar with the exhilaration and the sense of accomplishment; but you are also familiar with the sense of looking forwards: of standing at an inflection point, and seeing that future holds immeasurable joy along with a daunting effort.</p>
<p><strong>Why are Ganesh-able Moments so important?</strong><br />
Plenty of people have told you to take more risks, and I'm not here to tell you something so simple. Ganesh-able Moments offer you a way to keep things fresh and keep things interesting. They are the inflection points in life that let you continue to change and grow, and they don't come up all that often. I say, be on the lookout for the Ganesh-able Moments, and think long and hard before you pass one of them up. Odds are, you'll regret it if you do.</p>
