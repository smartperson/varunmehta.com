<p>This is the first post in a series on how Quitting is Hard (QiH). Each post will explore why quitting is good, one potential barrier to quitting, and a way to overcome it.</p>
<p><strong>Why is quitting important?<br />
</strong>Among other benefits, quitting offers you a fresh start. It's a way of picking up a new role with new responsibilities, new colleagues, and new opportunities for growth. You <em>do</em> want to make the kind of <strong>bold</strong> career change needed for a <a title="Graduation: Fill your life with “Ganesh-able Moments”" href="http://blog.disqovery.com/2013/07/graduation-fill-your-life-with-ganesh-able-moments/" target="_blank">Ganesh-able Moment</a>, don't you?<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>Why is quitting hard? </strong><em>Visualization.<br />
</em>You've been in your current job on a certain career path for a while. You're probably pretty good at it. You have the resumé, experience, and network to <em>keep</em> doing what you're doing. You are like a Formula One racecar: finely tuned for optimal performance, on a track, and racing towards a finish line in the distance. <em>Can you imagine racing down a different track, instead?</em></p>
<p>You might plan to eventually make a change in your career. But visualizing a different future and a different opportunity is a stumbling block for a number of <a title="The blog of a young man applying to business school now" href="http://hamm0.wordpress.com" target="_blank">pe0ple</a> I've advised. You have to break free, even just for a moment, to become receptive to everything out there.</p>
<p><strong>How do we overcome this obstacle? </strong><em>Visualization!<strong><br />
</strong></em>You've heard that visualization is a powerful tool, but it also falls in the realm of "self-help" gurus, motivational speakers, and others who want to "<a href="http://www.danlier.com/archives/1441" target="_blank">Maximize Your True Potential</a>." But behind all the marketing, there are useful, solid <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/flourish/200912/seeing-is-believing-the-power-visualization" target="_blank">scientific</a> <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-psychology-dress/201111/visualize-it" target="_blank">foundations</a> - that also carry some <a href="http://www.bps.org.uk/news/are-positive-fantasies-counterproductive" target="_blank">risk</a>.</p>
<p>Jo Tango (<a href="https://twitter.com/jtangoVC" target="_blank">@jtangoVC</a>) is a venture capitalist who recently wrote a great post about how he decided to start his own investment firm and later applied the technique to an entrepreneur friend of his, called "<a title="Jo's Blog Post" href="http://jtangovc.com/how-a-blank-sheet-of-paper-changed-my-life/" target="_blank">How a Blank Sheet of Paper Changed My Life</a>."</p>
<p>With credit to Jo, I want to remix this idea a bit.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 14px;"><b>Grab a blank piece of paper and a pen.</b> The right tools for an important job.</span></li>
<li><b>Get a little quiet time.</b> Even just 15 minutes. Ideally not on a work day - you want a fresh mind, free of mental baggage from work.</li>
<li><strong>Ask yourself a few questions: </strong>In an ideal future, where am I? What am I doing? What kind of people (if any) am I interacting with?</li>
<li><strong>Let your mind wander.</strong> Go where it takes you. Resist the urge to think about your current position.<br />
<strong></strong></li>
<li><strong>Write or draw.</strong> Putting your thoughts down on paper makes a big difference; it gives you something tangible to look at. You can either build upon it or take a different direction, but in either case you are making progress.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our goal here isn't to build a life plan, or even a career plan; it's to jump-start your career visualization skills. This way when an opportunity comes along, it's easier to imagine yourself in that role and making that leap.</p>
<p><strong>My personal experience</strong></p>
<p>I went through a similar exercise at the start of my MBA program, and found the experience both cryptic and enlightening. To paraphrase my experience: I saw myself in open spaces, interacting with many people, learning about their passions, and really <em>helping</em> them. <em>But what did it all mean?</em> Coming from a purely technical background this felt strange at first. But then I started to look into opportunities in HR and VC, areas I'd never considered before. It began a period of exploration which has been an incredible journey. Now I'm working on Disqovery; I was guided by this exercise and the experiences that followed.</p>
<p>I'm racing on a different track now.</p>
