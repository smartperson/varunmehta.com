_The start of what should be an entertaining and educational journey. Let's play with Raspberry Pis, and make them do all kinds of fun things to make our lives better. Casually._

This is the first post in a series covering the project I'm working on in my spare time. My hope is to inspire some of you to try something new; maybe even using some of my mistakes to make it easier for next time:

* Part 1: Overview and quick preview
* Part 2: Fun with sensors
* Part 3: Displays
* Part 4: Casual networking
* Part 5: Bonus features
* Part 6: Physical constraints

#### What is a "casual smart home"?
