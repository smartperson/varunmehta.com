_Overview and quick preview. The start of what should be an entertaining and educational journey. Let's play with Raspberry Pis, and make them do all kinds of fun things to make our lives better. Casually._

This is the first post in a series covering the project I'm working on in my spare time. My hope is to inspire some of you to try something new; maybe even using some of my mistakes to make it easier for next time:

* Part 1: Overview and quick preview
* Part 2: Fun with sensors
* Part 3: Displays
* Part 4: Casual networking
* Part 5: Bonus features
* Part 6: Physical constraints

#### What is the "casual smart home"?

You can call it lazy, if you want, but when I want to build technology for my home, there are some principles I try to stick to:

1. **Easy to update.** Don't worry about firmware updates or plugging in to reconfigure and put new code on my devices.
2. **Roll with the punches.** Don't fail, crash, and lock up until a manual restart. Figure out a way to keep functioning, and report the error.
3. **Dynamic configuration.** Figure out as much about the environment as possible without manual entry. If a new device appears, add it. If an old device disappears, remove it.
4. **No apps required.** Information at a glance. Don't make me use a app to find something out.
