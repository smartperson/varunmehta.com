_The start of what should be an entertaining and educational journey. Let's play with Raspberry Pis, and make them do all kinds of fun things to make our lives better. Casually._



#### What do you want from your people? From yourself?

are interrelated:

* Get the best performance I can from my team.
* Make sure that my people have what they need to do a good job.
* Have a team that feels good about their workplace, their capabilities, and their growth.
* Be respected as a capable leader.

## The service connection

This concept isn't new. There are great examples, including from the military, in the book *[Leaders Eat Last](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845327/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591845327&linkCode=as2&tag=varmeh-20&linkId=5c7f7808ddd31482a4d03f69428f025e){:target='_blank'}*. *As an aside, the author Simon Sinek, has a great TED talk you must check out.*



#### I. Watch your words

> * *Never say, “Good choice,” implying that other choices are bad.*
> * *Saying, “No problem” is a problem. It has a tone of insincerity or sarcasm. “My pleasure” or “You’re welcome” will do.*
> * *Do not gossip about co-workers or guests within earshot of guests.*

**Words always matter, but they're especially important when you're in a leadership position.** There are two main reasons for this. First, you are respected by your team, and it's easy to lose some of that respect by saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. Second, *your words have influence, both direct and indirect*. For example, speaking poorly of a colleague can result in their teammates excluding them from work and non-work activities.
