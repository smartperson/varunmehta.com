<p>Before we get too deep into our conversations on the quarter-life crisis, let's set up a solid definition of what it is, and a reason why it's not such a bad thing.</p>
<p><b>A definition<br />
</b>There are <a href="http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/05/14/millennials-being-hit-by-quarter-life-crisis/" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="http://www.tlnt.com/2013/07/01/helping-your-millennial-employees-through-their-quarter-life-crisis/" target="_blank">marketing-speak</a> <a href="http://theonceandfuturecoffeeaddict.com/2012/07/16/the-ballad-of-the-millennial-having-a-quarter-life-crisis/" target="_blank">definitions</a> of the quarter-life crisis that refer to age brackets, 'millennials', etc. Though I do think there are generational and demographic trends, let's go a bit deeper.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p><i>You know you're in your quarter-life crisis when:<br />
</i></p>
<ol>
<li>You're in the early stage of your career, however you define that.</li>
<li>You've had a couple of jobs, but don't know what you want to be when you 'grow up.'</li>
<li>You know the next 'logical' step, but don't know if it's right for you.</li>
<li>Everyone around you is tired of hearing about <a href="http://hamm0.wordpress.com">your</a> career woes.</li>
<li>This list is not exhaustive. If you have other interesting indicators, <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?in_reply_to=368023321444483072" target="_blank">send us a tweet</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Why is it a good thing? You can still change.<br />
</b></p>
<p>Many people are discussing how the employment market has changed, and the "<a title="Link to HBR article" href="http://hbr.org/2013/06/tours-of-duty-the-new-employer-employee-compact" target="_blank">new employer-employee compact</a>" is a very real reality. Career and life are both much more fluid now.</p>
<p><b></b>You might wish for the simpler bygone days, when your career path was laid out, you had a steady job, and there were no surprises. <i>But, no!</i> By dealing with these issues of direction now you can much more easily handle them than later in life, during a mid-life crisis.</p>
<p><b>The mid-life crisis is a crisis of <i>reflection</i>. But the quarter-life crisis is a crisis of <i>anticipation</i>.<br />

<p><b></b>The difference here is pretty big. Individuals in their 40's and 50's look <i>back</i> at their lives and try to make sense of it all; they wonder why things turned out the way they did, and sometimes try to make <i>radical</i> changes relatively late in life.</p>
<p>In your 20's and 30's you're still at the beginning of a journey; looking <i>forward</i> you wonder where you want to go and where life will take you. You're presented with an unfathomable array of possibilities at a time when even <i>subtle</i> changes can ripple and have a big impact.</p>
