<p><strong>With Disqovery I really like to talk about company vision</strong>, and the topic of Big Data invariably comes up. As early-stage startups go, you don't often have enough data to really fall into that category. Let's face it: even with 300+ users, and <em>some</em> of them doing <a title="What job check-ins are and why you need to start doing them right now" href="http://blog.disqovery.com/2013/11/disqovery-what-are-job-check-ins/" target="_blank">job check-ins</a>, we're nowhere near <em>big</em> data.</p>
<h1><strong>But what about <em>small</em> data?</strong></h1>
<p>Disqovery is now providing meaningful <em>personal analytics</em> based on your check-in data. With every check-in we'll be able to provide more and more precise insights based on what you share. In marketing-speak: We're Taking Data Science and Bringing it Your Career.™</p>
<p>Disqovery had some basic analytics before, but thanks to some smart people now we're doing it right. For starters, our skills-based check-in analysis has become much more rigorous. This includes the foundation of all data analysis, the multi-variate linear regression. That means that when you tell us how good or bad a given day is, we can actually figure out how much each skill <em>adds</em> or <em>detracts</em> from that day's experience.</p>

<h2>Statistics are cool</h2>
<p>With statistics we don't just figure out <em>magnitude</em> but also <strong>certainty</strong>. Using the right modeling techniques means that as you check in more, our answers will get more and more accurate. The downside is that for your first several check-ins you're going to see 'low' confidence scores. Just keep up the check-ins, and you'll climb your way up the statistical ladder.</p>
<p><em>So get checking in, and get excited about being empowered by personal analytics from Disqovery. You want to try Disqovery? Are you already a user but haven't enabled job check-ins yet?</em></p>
